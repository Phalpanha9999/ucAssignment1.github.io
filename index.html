Networking Lab<br>
The infrastructure of the Networking Laboratory was designed to simulate a network connecting multiple devices such as computers, servers, and printers with different types of physical communication links. The interconnections between these virtual locations are slightly asymmetric, permitting interesting routing phenomena to be demonstrated. This laboratory is designed for the purpose of enhancing student’s understanding of the concepts discussed in a variety of networks and data communication. The Networking Laboratory also reinforces fundamental concepts and theories associated with the network’s physical layer, data link layer, network layer, transport layer, and application layer. The lab Includes simu¬lations devoted to Internet activities, Windows Server or Linux, and PC hardware. The desired learning outcome from this lab is that the student can understand the network infrastructure within a Local Area Network (LAN) as well as over a Wide Area Network (WAN). And to inspire them about the tasks of a network administrator. They can also understand the func¬tion of network devices clearly. This lab is also used to teach students about computer programming tools, and to allow students to learn and practice programming, and web programming such as html, Cascade Style Sheet (CSS), JavaScript, etc. The Networking Laboratory is equipped with 51 computers running under the NetSupport School software. All PCs run on Windows 7.
